Enhancing body detection in CSSR Operations Using Advanced Technology


Proposed Idea
Deploying drones equipped with:
 ➢ GPRs (Ground Penetrating Radars)
 ➢ Thermal Imaging camera
 ➢ Multispectral imaging sensors
 ➢ LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors
 ➢ Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Sensors
❑ The drones will scan the area flying in a specific formation(5 drones) as a team, each drone carrying a different sensor thus reducing the load on individual drones and gathering data collectively.
